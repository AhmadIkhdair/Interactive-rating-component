## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript (jQuery)

### What I learned

Focused most on the javascript section of this project. Made sure to include an error to if a user submits without choosing a rating. Gave the user the option to click on his selected choice to cancel it. Tried my best to make the code as error free as possible!

### Continued development

Much more to learn with javascript, looking forward to learning how to be more effecient when programmingand making sure bugs do not exist.
